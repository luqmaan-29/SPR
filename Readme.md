[cite_start]This document is a **Lab Manual** [cite: 2] [cite_start]for the course **Speech Processing and Recognition** (MAI574)[cite: 4, 5].

[cite_start]It belongs to the **Department of Computer Science** [cite: 1] [cite_start]at **CHRIST (Deemed to be University)** [cite: 1, 6] for the **V MSc. [cite_start]AI and ML** (Master of Science Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) class during the 2025-26 academic year[cite: 6, 7, 8].

[cite_start]The manual outlines the aims, theory, procedure, and expected results for **nine laboratory exercises** [cite: 13, 222, 477, 709, 1026, 1168, 1364, 1497, 1673] [cite_start]covering core topics in speech signal processing, including[cite: 35, 259, 516, 711, 1045, 1189, 1377, 1520, 1676]:
* Sampling and Reconstruction
* Fourier Transform and Spectrum Analysis
* Speech-to-Text (ASR) Comparison
* Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)
* Time Alignment Techniques (LTN and DTW)
* Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Viterbi Decoding

[cite_start]The document contains Python code implementations, detailed observations, results (including MSE values and comparison tables), plots, and concluding inferences for each lab[cite: 69, 1571, 799, 1070, 1213, 1412, 1745].
